# ansible-spacewalk project

      Spacewalk is an open-source package and system management solution 
      for RedHat derivative distributions like CentOS, Scientific Linux and 
      Fedora, developed by the spacewalk community.

      for the system that are registered with Spacewalk, 
      and we can initiate the task such as install, update, inventory, and so on.
